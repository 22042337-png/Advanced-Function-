  <h1>All 9 Functions Project</h1>

  <!-- Function 1 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>1. Polynomial of degree higher than 2</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ksggkbdhjq?lang=zh-CN"></iframe>
    <div class="math">y = x³ - 5x {-1.9 ≤ x ≤ -1.6361}</div>
    <p> <strong>Transformations Paragraph:</strong> In this picture, the function I have chosen is a polynomial of degree higher than 2 (with more than one term). The parent function is y = x³. The transformed function is y = x³ - 5x. The term -5x tilts and reshapes the cubic curve. The graph still passes through the origin, but it now has three x-intercepts (at (x = 0) and (x =sqrt{5}or x=-sqrt{5}). The addition of -5x causes the graph to develop two turning points, making it look like an S-shaped curve stretched horizontally. </p >
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-1.9 ≤ x ≤ -1.6361}. Range: {2.641 ≤ y ≤ 3.80094}. Challenge: Aligning function perfectly with the graph requires combining different functions.</p>
	</p > <p> <strong> Chanllages:</strong> I found it extremely difficult to make a single function align perfectly with the graph, so I used a combination of different functions to make them more similar. </p > 
  </div>
  <!-- Function 2 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>2. Absolute Value Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/luhnynn1yc?embed"></iframe>
    <div class="math">g(x) = -¾ (12/11 |x + 2.35|) + 1.45</div>
    <h2>Transformation:</h2> <p>The reason why I chose the absolute function for this graph because the roof of the castle is close to the shape of absolute function. This equation evolves the absolute function. The discrepancies from the parent function are:</p> <ul> <li>Reflection on x-axis</li> <li>Vertical compression by factor of 3/4</li> <li>Horizontal compression by factor of 11/12</li> <li>Vertical translation upward for 1.45 units</li> <li>Horizontal translation toward left for 2.35 units</li> </ul>
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-3 ≤ x ≤ 3.1}, Range: {0.69 ≤ y ≤ 1.5}. Challenge: Connecting different functions together smoothly.</p>
   <h2>Thinking</h2> <p>The most challenging part is connecting different functions together. I needed to allocate the different functions to their position, and found the focal points. Then, I used the domain to present a part of them. The effect of my product shows as if every line is connected together.</p> 
  </div>

  <!-- Function 3 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>3. Cosine Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kgticovnh0?lang=zh-CN"></iframe>
    <div class="math">y = 0.7 cos(2.243x) - 0.7 {-1.73 ≤ x ≤ 2.6}</div>
    <p><strong>1. Transformations Paragraph:</strong><br> In this picture, the function I have chosen is a cosine function. The parent function is \(y = \cos x\). The transformed function is \(y = 0.7\cos(2.243x) - 0.7\). A vertical shrink by a factor of 0.7 (decreasing the amplitude from 1 to 0.7). A horizontal shrink by a factor of \(\frac{1}{2.243}\) (decreasing the period). </p >
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-1.73 ≤ x ≤ 2.6}, Range: {-1.23184 ≤ y ≤ -0.07011}. Challenge: Calculations require precision, used AI tool to assist.</p>
  <p><strong>Challenge:</strong><br> I found it difficult to calculate the functional equation after finding the point, as the numbers often required precision up to three decimal places, so I borrowed an AI tool to assist with the precise calculations.
  </p >
  </div>

  <!-- Function 4 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>4. Exponential Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z8dec5ifxx"></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = 0.8^{2.2(x-3)} - 1.8 {1.038967 ≤ x ≤ 4.5}</div>
    <p><strong>1. Transformations Paragraph:</strong><br> In this picture, the function I have chosen is a cosine function. The parent function is \(y = \cos x\). The transformed function is \(y = 0.7\cos(2.243x) - 0.7\). A vertical shrink by a factor of 0.7 (decreasing the amplitude from 1 to 0.7). A horizontal shrink by a factor of \(\frac{1}{2.243}\) (decreasing the period). </p >
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {1.038967 ≤ x ≤ 4.5}, Range: {-1.32115 ≤ y ≤ 0.81876}. Challenge: Connecting multiple functions smoothly.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional Explanation:</strong><br> The reason why I chose the exponential function for this graph is that the roller coaster is close to the shape of the exponential function.<br>
    <br> <strong>Challenge:</strong><br> When I do this, the most challenging part is the connections between several different functions. So I don't set the domain of each function at the first stage, so as to find the connection points between each function. </p >
  </div>

  <!-- Function 5 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>5. Reciprocal Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lv4wrufqww?embed"></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = (-7/3 x)/(-3/5(x+5)) - 7/3</div>
    <h2>Transformation:</h2> <p>The reason why I chose the reciprocal function because the bend of the reciprocal function is able to fit with the kink of the slide. This equation evolves the reciprocal function. The discrepancies from the parent function are:</p> <ul> <li>Vertical stretch by a factor of \( \tfrac{7}{3} \)</li> <li>Horizontal stretch by a factor of \( \tfrac{5}{3} \)</li> <li>Horizontal translation toward the left for 5 units</li> <li>Vertical translation downward for \( \tfrac{7}{3} \) units</li> <li>No hole</li> <li>Vertical asymptote at \( x = -5 \)</li> <li>Horizontal asymptote at \( y = \tfrac{35}{9} \)</li> </ul>
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-2 ≤ x ≤ 3.8}, Range: {-4.9 ≤ y ≤ -0.6}. Challenge: Identifying asymptotes and key points.</p>
   <h2>Thinking</h2>
  <p>I spent the most time identifying the V.A and H.A. Since I merely used a single function to present this graph, the process will be easy when I find the location of V.A and H.A. After that, I only need to find two points to calculate the value of a and k.</p> 
  </div>

  <!-- Function 6 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>6. Rational Function (1/x²)</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/37rv8hd9zz"></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = 0.7 / (0.2(x-1)²) - 2.2 {-5 ≤ x ≤ -0.514148}</div>
    <p><strong>Transformations Paragraph:</strong><br> In this picture, the function I have chosen is \( \frac{1}{x^{2}} \). The parent function is \( f(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}} \). The transformed function is \( f(x)=0.7\frac{1}{0.2(x-1)^{2}}-2.2 \). Vertical compression by a factor of 0.7. Horizontal stretch by a factor of \( 1/0.2 = 5 \). Horizontal translation 1 unit to the right. Vertical translation 2.2 units downward.</p>
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-5 ≤ x ≤ -0.514148}, Range: {-2.10278 ≤ y ≤ -0.673378}. Challenge: Matching graph using piecewise functions.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional Explanation:</strong><br> The reason why I chose the rational function for this graph is that the children's slide is close to the shape of the rational function.<br>
    <br> <strong>Challenge:</strong><br> When I do this, the most challenging part is making the function perfectly match the graph. So I used different functions (like \( z(x)=0.4^{0.6(x-4.9)}-1.7\{3.0272 \le x \le 5\} \)) to create a piecewise function to make it fit with the children's slide. </p >
  </div>

  <!-- Function 7 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>7. Square Root Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jiepthsc1n" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups"></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = 1.6√(4.6 - x) − 4.5 {−1 ≤ x}</div>
    <h2>Transformation:</h2> <p>The reason why I chose this function is that the kink structures are easily found in slides. This equation evolves the root function. The discrepancies from the parent function are:</p> <ul> <li>Reflection on y-axis</li> <li>Vertical stretch by a factor of 1.6</li> <li>Horizontal translation toward the right for 4.6 units</li> <li>Vertical translation downward for 4.5 units</li> </ul>
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {−4.2 ≤ x ≤ 4.6}, Range: {−4.5 ≤ y ≤ 2.5}. Challenge: Using multiple functions to fit helix slide shape.</p>
  <h2>Thinking</h2> 
  <p>The most challenging I met while I was working on the root function project was finding the appropriate functions to fit the shape of the slide. As the shape of this slide is a helix, the most functions that I had used were reciprocal function, log function, and root function; those functions can create the twisted line to fit the slide shape.</p> 
  
  </div>

  <!-- Function 8 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>8. Trigonometric Function with Asymptote (tan⁻¹)</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pzmu0fpfcv" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = 1.7 tan⁻¹(0.9(x+3.5)) {-3.49466 ≤ x ≤ 3.24055}</div>
    <p><strong>Transformations Paragraph:</strong><br> In this picture, the function I have chosen is a trigonometric function with an asymptote. The parent function is \( f(x)=\tan x \). \( f(x)=\tan^{-1}(x) \) is the inverse function of \( f(x)=\tan(x) \). The transformed function is \( f(x)=1.7\tan^{-1}(0.9(x+3.5)) \). Vertical stretch by a factor of 1.7. Horizontal stretch by a factor of \( 1/0.9 = 10/9 \). Horizontal translation 3.5 units to the left.</p >
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-3.49466 ≤ x ≤ 3.24055}, Range: {0.0081688 ≤ y ≤ 2.39262}. Challenge: Determining domains for function connections.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional Explanation:</strong><br> The reason why I chose the trigonometric function with an asymptote for this graph is that the water slide is close to the shape of the trigonometric function with an asymptote.<br>
    <br> <strong>Challenge:</strong><br> When I do this, the most challenging part is determining the domain of each function. So I don't set the domain of each function at the first stage, so as to find the connection points between each function. The domain of each function can be determined by the connection points of each function and the starting and ending positions of the functions (the values corresponding to the x-axis). </p >
  </div>

  <!-- Function 9 -->
  <div class="function-section">
    <h2>9. Logarithmic Function</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8ckbnl30rx" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <div class="math">f(x) = 1/2.4 log₂(1/2(x+7)) + 4.3 {-6.8 ≤ x ≤ -5.62}</div>
    <p><strong>Transformations Paragraph:</strong><br> In this picture, the function I have chosen is a logarithmic function. The parent function is \( f(x)=\log_{2}(x) \). The transformed function is \( \frac{1}{2.4}\log_{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}(x+7)\right)+4.3 \). Vertical compression by a factor of \( 1/2.4 = 5/12 \). Horizontal compression by a factor of 2. Horizontal translation 7 units to the left. Vertical translation 4.3 units upward.</p >
    <p><strong>Domain and Range:</strong> Domain: {-6.8 ≤ x ≤ -5.62}, Range: {2.915863 ≤ y ≤ 4.07695}. Challenge: Precisely connecting function to graphic.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional Explanation:</strong><br> The reason why I chose the logarithmic function for this graph is that the roller coaster is close to the shape of the logarithmic function.<br><br> <strong>Challenge:</strong><br> When I do this, the most challenging part is the connections and the relationship between the function graph and the graphic; I must get them very close. So I solved it by calculating the function and performing translations. </p >
